# steganologger
A VSCode extension to extract data logged in plots using the steganologger python script.

## Usage
Right click an image (only png files are accepted) in the explorer window. At the bottom of the context menu, the option "Decode image" will appear. If this option is chosen, the decoded text (if any) will be shown as a JSON document in the `Steganologger` view in the VSCode panel.
